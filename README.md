Bridge regression in a Bayesian framework,  using Monte Carlo methods in order to estimate the parameters. 
Estimation of the Bayesian Bridge regression using importance sampling method and Gibbs sampler (article The Bayesian Bridge (2014)).
Bayesian formulation can be an alternative against the constrained optimization problem
defined by the bridge model.
