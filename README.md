# BayesianBridgeRegression
Bridge regression in a Bayesian framework,  using Monte Carlo methods in order to estimate the parameters. 
Estimation of the Bayesian Bridge regression using importance sampling method and Gibbs sampler (article The Bayesian Bridge (2014)).
Bayesian formulation can be an alternative against the constrained optimization problem
defined by the bridge model.
The importance sampling method is based on the simulation of the parameters via an instrumental law that is easy to simulate using a fast and reliable simulator.
The underlying idea is to see if we can get similar results as the Gibbs sampler with a reasonable calculation time
using this much more direct method.
